# -Multilingual-RAG-Chatbot-for-Indian-Government-Schemes

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that answers questions about various Indian government schemes (like Ayushman Bharat, PM-KISAN, PMAY, etc.) in three languages: English, Tamil, and Hindi.

Built using OpenAI GPT, LangChain, FAISS, and Streamlit, the chatbot allows users to ask questions and get accurate responses by retrieving context directly from a PDF document.

ðŸš€ Features
   Multilingual Support: Ask questions in English, Tamil, or Hindi

   PDF-Based RAG: Uses official government scheme documents as source

   LangChain + FAISS: Vector search and context retrieval for accurate answers

   OpenAI GPT-4: High-quality natural language understanding and response

   Streamlit UI: Simple and responsive web interface

ðŸ§± Tech Stack:

   OpenAI GPT-4 (via LangChain)

   LangChain â€“ document loading, chunking, prompting

   FAISS â€“ vector store for semantic similarity search

   PyPDFLoader â€“ loading multilingual PDFs

   Streamlit â€“ web app frontend

ðŸ“Œ Notes:

Make sure the PDF (indian_govt_schemes.pdf) contains actual Tamil/Hindi/English content (Unicode).

For larger PDFs, FAISS may take a few seconds to index on first run.

All answers are generated using GPT based on retrieved document chunks.
